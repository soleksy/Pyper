During the experimental run the momentum of the deuteron beam was varied continuously within each acceleration cycle from 2.185 GeV/c to 2.400 GeV/c, crossing the kinematic threshold for the eta production in the dd to 4He eta reaction at 2.336 GeV/c. The preliminary excitation function indicates no structure in the angular range close to the 180 degree where the signal is expected. The preliminary estimation of the upper limit for the eta-mesic production via the dd to (eta 4He)b.s. to 3He p pi- reaction is equal to about 20 nb on a one sigma level. A two-week measurement with WASA-at-COSY for the dd 3He p pi- channel is scheduled for November 2010. After two weeks of measurement with a luminosity of 4 * 10^(30) cm^(-2) s^(-1), we expect a statistical sensitivity of a few nb sigma.",

This novel approach exploits the excellent time properties of the plastic scintillators, which permit very precise time measurements. The very fast, FPGA-based front-end electronics and the data acquisition system, as well as, low- and high-level reconstruction algorithms were specially developed to be used with the J-PET scanner. The TOF-PET data processing and reconstruction are time and resource demanding operations, especially in case of a large acceptance detector, which works in triggerless data acquisition mode. In this article, we discuss the parallel computing methods applied to optimize the data processing for the J-PET detector. We begin with general concepts of parallel computing and then we discuss several applications of those techniques in the J-PET data processing.",

The discovery of this new kind of an exotic nuclear matter would be very important for better understanding of the eta meson structure and its interaction with nucleons. The search for eta-mesic helium is carried out with high statistic and high acceptance with the WASA-at-COSY detection setup and the Cooler Synchrotron COSY. The search is conducted via the measurement of the excitation function for the chosen decay channels of the 4He-eta system. Until now two reactions dd -> (4He-eta)bound ->3Heppi- and dd -> (4He-eta)bound ->3Henpi0 have been measured with the beam momentum varied continuously around the eta meson production threshold. This contribution includes description of recently published results of the WASA-at-COSY experiment as well as brief presentation of preliminary results from the analysis of new data sample with 20 times larger statistics.",

New resources may come as part of pledged resources, while others are in the form of opportunistic ones. Most but not all of these new infrastructures are based on virtualization techniques. In addition, some of them, present opportunities for multi-processor computing slots to the users. Virtual Organizations are therefore facing heterogeneity of the available resources and the use of an Interware software like DIRAC to provide the transparent, uniform interface has become essential. The transparent access to the underlying resources is realized by implementing the pilot model. DIRAC\u2019s newest generation of generic pilots (the so-called Pilots 2.0) are the \u201cpilots for all the skies\u201d, and have been successfully released in production more than a year ago. They use a plugin mechanism that makes them easily adaptable. Pilots 2.0 have been used for fetching and running jobs on every type of resource, being it a Worker Node (WN) behind a CREAM/ARC/HTCondor/DIRAC Computing element, a Virtual Machine running on IaaC infrastructures like Vac or BOINC, on IaaS cloud resources managed by Vcycle, the LHCb High Level Trigger farm nodes, and any type of opportunistic computing resource. Make a machine a \u201cPilot Machine\u201d, and all diversities between them will disappear. This contribution describes how pilots are made suitable for different resources, and the recent steps taken towards a fully unified framework, including monitoring. Also, the cases of multi-processor computing slots either on real or virtual machines, with the whole node or a partition of it, is discussed.",

Determination of the profile of the excitation curve below the threshold of the dd-&gt;4He-eta reaction will allow to establish the binding energy and the width of the He-eta bound state. In June, 2008 first measurements of the excitation functions for the dd-&gt;3Heppi- reaction were performed. In the experiment we used a slowly ramped COSY deuteron beam, scanning the range of momenta corresponding to the variation of the excess energy for the 4He-eta system from -51.4 MeV to 22 MeV."

For these detectors, a general-purpose trigger and readout board (TRB) with on-board DAQ functionality was developed. Data readout and slow control is done via an Etrax processor running Linux and a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet interface. The original motivation and application of the hardware is the implementation of a 128-channel Time to Digital Converter (TDC) electronics based on the HPTDC from CERN (we achieve sigma = 40 ps resolution). However, it has been developed in a way to be detector independent and thus may serve for any high-speed data acquisition by using a flexible add-on board concept (interface connector 15 Gbit/s) and an optical link (2 Gbit/s). A large FPGA (Xilinx Virtex 4 LX40) and a TigerSharc DSP can be used as on-board resources for trigger and on-line analysis algorithms.",

It provides a development framework and a rich set of services for both Workload and Data Management tasks of large scientific communities. DIRAC is adopted by a growing number of collaborations, including LHCb, Belle2, CLIC, and CTA. The LHCb experiment will be upgraded during the second long LHC shutdown (2019-2020). At restart of data taking in Run 3, the instantaneous luminosity will increase by a factor of five. The LHCb computing model also need be upgraded. Oversimplifying, this translates into the need for significantly more computing power and resources, and more storage with respect to what LHCb uses right now. The DIRAC interware will keep being the tool to handle all of LHCb distributed computing resources. Within this contribution, we highlight the ongoing and planned efforts to ensure that DIRAC will be able to provide an optimal usage of its distributed computing resources. This contribution focuses on DIRAC plans for increasing the scalability of the overall system, taking in consideration that the main requirement is keeping a running system working. This requirement translates into the need of studies and developments within the current DIRAC architecture. We believe that scalability is about traffic growth, dataset growth, and maintainability: within this contribution we address all of them, showing the technical solutions we are adopting.",

It could potentially be used to improve the quality of reconstructed images in the J-PET scanner in 2+1 photon tomography. Firstly, a research is conducted for several radioisotopes that decay via \\b{eta}+ decay followed by de-excitation of an excited nucleus. Efficiency, purity and false positive rate are calculated for each isotope as a function of energy deposited threshold, with a hypothesis that signals caused by 511 keV photons deposit smaller values of energy than 1 z 13the selected threshold, while prompt photons deposit larger energy than the threshold. Analysis of the results accompanied with physical properties of radioisotopes suggests using 44 Sc, which is the most promising candidate for medical applications. With the use of GATE and J-POS simulation software, in-phantom scattering was introduced and the best energy deposited threshold value was estimated to be approximately 375 keV. It corresponds to almost 100% efficiency for 511 keV signals, 75% purity for 511 keV photons, and approximately 70% efficiency and purity for prompt photons.",

In Time of Flight PET (TOF-PET), fast detectors are able to measure the difference in the arrival time of the two gamma rays, with the precision enabling to shorten significantly a range along the line-of-response (LOR) where the annihilation occurred. In the new concept, called J-PET scanner, gamma rays are detected in plastic scintillators. In a single strip of J-PET system, time values are obtained by probing signals in the amplitude domain. Owing to Compress Sensing theory, information about the shape and amplitude of the signals is recovered. In this paper we demonstrate that based on the acquired signals parameters, a better signal normalization may be provided in order to improve the TOF resolution. The procedure was tested using large sample of data registered by a dedicated detection setup enabling sampling of signals with 50 ps intervals. Experimental setup provided irradiation of a chosen position in the plastic scintillator strip with annihilation gamma quanta.",

The best fit gives space to a yield of ppK \u2212 /K \u2212 sto p = (0.044 \u00b1 0.009 stat + 0 . 004 \u2212 0 . 005 syst) \u00d7 10 \u2212 2 corresponding to a binding energy and a width of 45 and 30 MeV/c 2 , respectively.

Those events were recorded by the KLOE detector, used as an active target, installed in the the DA\u03a6NE collider. The results show that it is possible to isolate the process where the K\u2212 is absorbed by two nucleons and the decay products are emitted without any further final state interactions among other contributions involving more than two nucleons. Further, the possible contribution of a ppK\u2212 bound state was investigated. The best fit gives space to a yield of ppK\u2212/Kstop\u2212 = (0.044 \u00b1 0.009 stat\u22120.005+0.004) \u00d7 10\u22122 corresponding to a binding energy and a width of 45 and 30 MeV/c2, respectively.

This constitutes a very powerful tool for testing at the utmost precision the quantum coherence of the entangled kaon pair state, and to search for tiny decoherence and CPT violation effects, which may be justified in a quantum gravity framework. The analysed data sample was collected with the KLOE detector at DA$\\Phi$NE, the Frascati $\\phi$-factory, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 1.7 fb$^{-1}$, i.e. to $\\sim 1.7 \\times 10^9$ $\\phi\\rightarrow K_S K_L$ decays. From the fit of the observed $\\Delta t$ distribution, being $\\Delta t$ the difference of the kaon decay times, the decoherence and CPT violation parameters of various phenomenological models are measured with a largely improved accuracy with respect to previous analyses. The results are consistent with no deviation from quantum mechanics and CPT symmetry, while for some parameters the precision reaches the interesting level at which -- in the most optimistic scenarios -- quantum gravity effects might show up. They provide the most stringent limits up to date on the considered models.",

We take advantage of the fact that for this kind of detectors amplitude and shape of registered signals depends strongly on the position where particle hit the detector. The reconstruction is based on determination of the degree of similarity between measured and averaged signals stored in a library for a set of well-defined positions along the scintillator. Preliminary results of validation of the introduced method with experimental data obtained by means of the double strip prototype of the J-PET detector are presented.",

              "value": "In this article, a new method for the reconstruction of hit-position and hit-time of photons in long scintillator detectors is investigated. This research is motivated by the recent development of the positron emission tomography scanners based on plastic scintillators. The proposed method constitutes a new way of signal processing in Multi-Voltage-Technique. It is based on the determination of the degree of similarity between the registered signals and the synchronized model signals stored in a library. The library was established for a set of well defined hit-positions along the length of the scintillator. The Mahalanobis distance was used as a measure of similarity between the two compared signals. The method was validated on the experimental data measured using two-strips J-PET prototype with dimensions of 5x9x300 mm$^3$. The obtained Time-of-Flight (TOF) and spatial resolutions amount to 325~ps (FWHM) and 25~mm (FWHM), respectively. The TOF resolution was also compared to the results of an analogous study done using Linear Fitting method. The best TOF resolution was obtained with this method at four pre-defined threshold levels which was comparable to the resolution achieved from the Mahalanobis distance at two pre-defined threshold levels. Although the algorithm of Linear Fitting method is much simpler to apply than the Mahalanobis method, the application of the Mahalanobis distance requires a lower number of applied threshold levels and, hence, decreases the costs of electronics used in PET scanner.",

The measurements were performed at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY-Juelich with the WASA-at-COSY detection system.The internal deuteron beam of COSY was scattered on a pellet-type deuteron target. The data were taken during a slow acceleration of the beam from 2.185 GeV/c to 2.400 GeV/c crossing the kinematical threshold for the eta production in the dd->4He-eta reaction at 2.336 GeV/c. The corresponding excess energy in the 4He-eta system varied from -51.4 MeV to 22 MeV. Events corresponding to decays of the eta-mesic 4He were selected using cuts on the 3He momentum, p and pi- kinetic energies and the relative p-pi- angle in the center of mass system. The range of the applied cuts was inferred from simulations of decay of the 4He-eta bound state proceeding via excitation the N* resonance. The integrated luminosity in the experiment was determined using the dd->3He-n reaction and the relative normalization of the points of the dd->3Heppi- excitation function was based on the quasi-elastic proton-proton scattering. No signal of the 4He-eta bound state was observed in the excitation function. An upper limit for the cross-section for the bound state formation and decay in the process dd->(4He-eta)_bound->3Heppi- determined for the bound state width of 10, 20 and 30 MeV equals to 28, 32 and 41 nb, respectively. The measured angular and momentum distributions of the reaction products are close to those simulated under the assumption of uniform phase-space distribution.",

              "value": "Time-Over-Threshold (TOT) technique is being used widely due to its implications in developing the multi channel readouts mainly when fast signal processing is required. Using TOT technique as a measure of energy loss instead of charge integration methods significantly reduces the signals readout cost by combining the time and energy information. Therefore, this approach can potentially be used in J-PET tomograph which is build from plastic scintillators characterized by fast light signals. The drawback in adopting this technique is lying in the non-linear correlation between input energy loss and TOT of the signal. The main motivation behind this work is to develop the relationship between TOT and energy loss and validate it with the J-PET tomograph. The experiment was performed using the $^{22}$Na beta emitter source placed in the center of the J-PET tomograph. One can obtain primary photons of two different energies: 511 keV photon from the annihilation of positron (direct annihilation or through the formation of para-Positronim atom or pick-off process of ortho-Positronium atoms), and 1275 keV prompt photon. This allows to study the correlation between TOT values and energy loss for energy range up to 1000 keV. As the photon interacts dominantly via Compton scattering inside the plastic scintillator, there is no direct information of primary photon energy. However, using the J-PET geometry one can measure the scattering angle of the interacting photon. Since, $^{22}$Na source emits photons of two different energies, it is required to know unambiguously the energy of incident photons and its corresponding scattering angle for the estimation of energy deposition. In this work, the relationship between Time Over Threshold and energy loss by interacting photons inside the plastic scintillators used in J-PET scanner is established for a energy deposited range 100-1000 keV",

In an improved reanalysis of COSY-11 data for the $pp\\to ppK^+K^-$ reaction at excess energies of Q = 10 MeV and 28 MeV including the proton-K- interaction the enhancement is confirmed. Invariant mass distributions for the two- and three-particle subsystems allow to test at low excess energies the ansatz and parameters for the description of the interaction in the ppK+K- system as derived from the COSY-ANKE data. Finally, based for the first time on the low energy K+K- invariant mass distributions and the generalized Dalitz plot analysis, we estimate the scattering length for the K+K- interaction to be |Re(a_K^+K^-)| = 0.5 + 4.0 -0.5 fm and Im(a_K^+K^-) = 3.0 +- 3.0 fm.",

The experiments were carried out with the WASA detector setup at COSY. Similar to the observation in the basic $pn \\to d \\pi^0\\pi^0$ reaction, the data reveal a correlation between the ABC effect and a resonance-like energy dependence in the total cross section. The maximum occurs at m=2.37 GeV + 2$m_N$, i.e. at the same position as in the basic reaction. The observed resonance width $\\Gamma \\approx$ 160 MeV can be understood from broadening due to Fermi motion of the nucleons in initial and final nuclei together with collision damping. Differential cross sections are described equally well by the hypothesis of a $pn$ resonance formation during the reaction process."

The tasks of the STT are the measurement of the particle momentum from the reconstructed trajectory and the measurement of the specific energy-loss for a particle identification. Dedicated simulations with full analysis studies of certain proton-antiproton reactions, identified as being benchmark tests for the whole PANDA scientific program, have been performed to test the STT layout and performance.

It is going to address fundamental questions of hadron physics and quantum chromodynamics using cooled antiproton beams with a high intensity and and momenta between 1.5 and 15 GeV/c. PANDA is designed to reach a maximum luminosity of 2x10^32 cm^2 s. Most of the physics programs require an excellent particle identification (PID). The PID of hadronic states at the forward endcap of the target spectrometer will be done by a fast and compact Cherenkov detector that uses the detection of internally reflected Cherenkov light (DIRC) principle. It is designed to cover the polar angle range from 5{\\deg} to 22{\\deg} and to provide a separation power for the separation of charged pions and kaons up to 3 standard deviations (s.d.) for particle momenta up to 4 GeV/c in order to cover the important particle phase space. This document describes the technical design and the expected performance of the novel PANDA Disc DIRC detector that has not been used in any other high energy physics experiment (HEP) before. The performance has been studied with Monte-Carlo simulations and various beam tests at DESY and CERN. The final design meets all PANDA requirements and guarantees suffcient safety margins.",

Furthermore, the background versus signal efficiency, statistical and systematical uncertainties on the extracted proton form factors are evaluated using two different procedures.

The statistical precision with which the proton form factors can be determined is estimated. The signal channel $\\bar p p \\to e^+ e^-$ is studied on the basis of two different but consistent procedures. The suppression of the main background channel, $\\textit{i.e.}$ $\\bar p p \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, is studied. Furthermore, the background versus signal efficiency, statistical and systematical uncertainties on the extracted proton form factors are evaluated using two different procedures. The results are consistent with those of a previous simulation study using an older, simplified framework. However, a slightly better precision is achieved in the PandaRoot study in a large range of momentum transfer, assuming the nominal beam conditions and detector performance.",

At high center-of-mass energy and high invariant mass squared of the lepton pair q$^{2}$, the amplitude of the signal channel $\\bar pp \\to e^ + e^ - \\pi ^0 $ admits a QCD factorized description in terms of \u03c0N TDAs and nucleon Distribution Amplitudes (DAs) in the forward and backward kinematic regimes. Assuming the validity of this factorized description, we perform feasibility studies for measuring $\\bar pp \\to e^ + e^ - \\pi ^0 $ with the P\u0304ANDA detector. Detailed simulations on signal reconstruction efficiency as well as on rejection of the most severe background channel, i.e. $\\bar pp \\to \\pi ^ + \\pi ^ - \\pi ^0 $ were performed for the center-of-mass energy squared s = 5 GeV$^{2}$ and s = 10 GeV$^{2}$, in the kinematic regions 3.0 < q$^{2}$ < 4.3 GeV$^{2}$ and 5 < q$^{2}$ GeV$^{2}$, respectively, with a neutral pion scattered in the forward or backward cone $\\left| {\\cos \\theta _{\\pi ^0 } } \\right| > 0.5$ in the proton-antiproton center-of-mass frame. Results of the simulation show that the particle identification capabilities of the P\u0304ANDA detector will allow to achieve a background rejection factor of 5 \u00b7 10$^{7}$ (1 \u00b7 10$^{7}$) at low (high) q$^{2}$ for s = 5 GeV$^{2}$, and of 1 \u00b7 10$^{8}$ (6 \u00b7 10$^{6}$) at low (high) q$^{2}$ for s = 10 GeV$^{2}$, while keeping the signal reconstruction efficiency at around 40%. At both energies, a clean lepton signal can be reconstructed with the expected statistics corresponding to 2 fb$^{\u22121}$ of integrated luminosity. The cross sections obtained from the simulations are used to show that a test of QCD collinear factorization can be done at the lowest order by measuring scaling laws and angular distributions. The future measurement of the signal channel cross section with P\u0304ANDA will provide a new test of the perturbative QCD description of a novel class of hard exclusive reactions and will open the possibility of experimentally accessing \u03c0 TDAs.",
