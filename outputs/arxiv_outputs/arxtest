   Collisions in a system of two particles at energies close to a bound state in
different channels are discussed. Next, the bound state decays into a third
coupled channel. A phenomenological approach to dd->pi-p3He reaction is
presented.

   We conduct a search for the 4He-eta bound state with the WASA-at-COSY
facility via the measurement of the excitation function for the reaction
dd->3Heppi-. In first experiment performed in June 2008, we used COSY deuteron
beam with a slowly ramped beam momentum corresponding to a variation of the
excess energy for the 4He-eta system from -51.4 MeV to 22 MeV. Here we report
on the status of the measurement and the data evaluation.

   We search for an evidence of eta-mesic He with the WASA detector. Two
dedicated experiments were performed at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY-Juelich.
The experimental method is based on the measurement of the excitation functions
for the two reaction channels: dd->3Heppi- and dd->3Henpi0, where the outgoing
N-pi pairs originate from the conversion of the eta meson on a nucleon inside
the He nucleus.In this contribution, the experimental method is shortly
described and the current status of the analysis is presented.

   The most recent results from the KLOE experiment are presented, covering: the
measurement of the running fine-structure constant alpha_em,the Dalitz plot
measurement of eta to pi+pi-pi0, the search of a U boson, tests of discrete
symmetries and quantum coherence. The KLOE-2 Collaboration will take data until
mid 2018 aiming to collect 5 inversed fb increasing the data set, in order to
produce new precision measurements and continue studies of fundamental
symmetries and New Physics.

   LHCb continues to expand its world-leading sample of charmed hadrons
collected during LHC's Run 1 (2010-2012) and Run 2 (2015-present). This sample
is yielding some of the most stringent tests of the Standard Model
understanding of charm physics. This includes precise measurements of the
neutral D-meson mixing parameters and some of the most sensitive searches for
direct and indirect CP violation in charm interactions.

   In this report the search for eta-mesic nuclei is reviewed. The brief
description of the experimental studies is presented with a focus on the
possible production of the eta-nucleus bound states for light nuclei like 4He

   We have measured excitation function for dp -> ppp_pi- reaction near the eta
production threshold. We observe an enhancement of the counting rate above the
threshold which can originate from the production of the eta meson in the
reaction dp -> 3He eta and its subsequent absorption on neutron in the 3He
nucleus leading to creation of the p_pi- pair.
